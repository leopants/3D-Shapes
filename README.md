# 3D-Shapes
Calculates the volume and surface area of different three dimensional shapes

## How to Run
The dimensions of the shapes are hard coded and must be changed in order to compute the area of these shapes

## What did I Learn
I learned the use of abstract classes as well as using an inherited super class.
I learned to implement the many uses of polymorphic coding within Java.
